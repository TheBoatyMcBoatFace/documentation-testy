## Problem Statement
***Example:*** *The problem is that the website is not loading properly on some devices. When users try to access the site on their phone, they are unable to load the page and are greeted with an error message instead. This is causing frustration among our users and we need to find a solution as soon as possible.*

## Recommendation
***Example:*** *One potential solution to this issue could be to optimize the website for mobile devices. This could involve ensuring that all page elements are properly scaled and aligned for smaller screens, and improving the website's overall performance on mobile devices. Additionally, we could also consider implementing responsive design techniques to make the website more user-friendly on mobile devices. These changes should help to improve the user experience and reduce the number of errors encountered when accessing the site on a mobile device.*

## Rationale
***Example:*** *Implementing this solution is necessary to ensure that our website remains accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices. An increasing number of users are accessing the internet on mobile devices, so it is crucial that our website is optimized for these devices. This will also help to improve the website's performance and reduce errors, resulting in a better overall user experience.*


## Other Options Considered
***Example:*** *Another option that we considered was to create a separate mobile app for our website. This would allow us to tailor the user experience specifically for mobile devices, and potentially provide additional features not available on the website. However, this option was ultimately deemed too time-consuming and costly to pursue at this time. Instead, we will focus on optimizing the website for mobile devices, which should provide a more immediate and cost-effective solution.*
